# Advanced-project
Final project for Advanced Concepts in Computer Coding 2020

1. This project asks for the user to input the full path to a csv file, which it will then use columns of data to make a variety of graphs using bokeh. The bokeh plots pop up in the user's browser window.
2. I selected this project because I wanted to explore an IDE and chose PyCharm, start a GitHub account and begin to learn how to use it, and to implement a data visualization for which I chose bokeh. I was able to achieve these objectives.
3. The first theme I selected was data visualization. In my project I'm using bokeh to visualize data provided by the user. The other major class theme I chose was using an IDE, so all of my project was developed in PyCharm.
4. If I were to have the opportunity to redo this project, I would make the data visualization more interactive and have it be more automatic with axes so that it was even easier and more foolproof for the user.
5. Download the files from GitHub, click run, and type in the full path to a csv file of data with observations in rows, an indentifier as the first column, and variables with data as columns.
6. This project was challenging more on the front end. Downloading PyCharm and setting up a GitHub account was straightforward, but connecting the two so I could commit and push changes was more challenging than I expected. It was also much more difficult to implement the stacked bar graph than I expected.

8. For a third major theme for extra credit, I incorporated the theme of version control into my project. I was able to use Git via GitHub to version control. I also used the try/except in the beginning of my code to print a message if the file path was invalid.
